This project is a training project for designing management systems in cpp, we will building this project over a series of sessions in our C++ webinars series, the system resembles a vending machine but more of a vending store to allow the automation of buying groceries using an subscribtion to the system (free or paid) and recieving the products from a drive-thru.

We started this series in Session 4 and here are the list of updates.

* Session 4:
  - We discuss designing the program, plan a rough UML diagram and define some of the classes.

* Session 5: 3/5/2020
  - We go over Polymorphism and examples of how it may be used, especially in our program
  - We roughly plan the login verification routine. 
  - We also cover a brief introduction of the map class from STL library and how it can be used in our program.
